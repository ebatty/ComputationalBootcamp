# Introduction

Welcome to the course site for Quantitative Methods for Biologists (Neurobio 323QC), also known as Quantitative Methods Bootcamp or Python Bootcamp!

# Course description
The goal of this bootcamp is to introduce you to programming in Python and to show you the power this provides for analyzing data and for gaining intuition about the behavior of complex systems through the use of numerical simulations. Some of you, upon encountering in the previous sentence words like "programming" and "numerical simulations," will feel the cold hand of fear grip your stomach, because you have never done any programming and, in fact, have tried to avoid math as much as possible. If so, YOU ARE PRECISELY THE PERSON WE HAD IN MIND as we were planning the course. We are aiming to help you break through this barrier of darkness and fear into the radiant sunshine of quantitative enlightenment. The true beauty of Python, as we will personally demonstrate, is that it allows people who are not mathematically adept (e.g. some of the instructors of this course) to use powerful numerical methods and visualization tools to gain an understanding of concepts that are very difficult to grasp analytically.

This course is based heavily on the Matlab version, pioneered by Mike Springer and Richard Born: https://springerlab.org/qmbc/.

# Components of course
*Videos*: We will release videos and corresponding text introducing core concepts for you to watch on your own before class (no more than 1.5 hours of videos per class). Note these are new based on last minute switch to online learning (to reduce time spent on zoom) 

*Live sessions*: During live sessions on zoom (which occur every other day), we will recap video content, go through examples, and work in small groups through problems.

*Homework*: There will be homework to complete between live sessions. You may collaborate with other students on homework but must submit your own.

*Homework help sessions*: On days without live sessions, there will be optional homework help sessions/office hours with instructors and TAs.

# Prerequisites
None! This is designed as an introduction to coding and introduction to Python. While the homeworks center around biological contexts, no biological knowledge is assumed. 

Some students will have more prior coding knowledge - we will try to have these students work with each other so they can advance more quickly and try more advanced optional exercises.


# Grading
This class is graded pass/fail. In order to pass, we expect you to attend the five full-day sessions, participate in the in-class exercises, and complete the compulsory part of the homework assignments.
