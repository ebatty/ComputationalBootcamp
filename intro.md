# Introduction

Welcome to the course site for the SURF program Computational Bootcamp!

## Description

Coding and quantitative skills have become increasingly indispensable tools in modern neuroscience research. This boot camp aims to empower SURF fellows in their research endeavours by equipping them with these skills. Students will learn the basics of Python coding, focusing on the principles and packages most useful for neuroscientists. Computational thinking skills and neural data analysis will be incorporated throughout the boot camp. 

**Learning Objectives**
*  Write Python code for research, using both basic coding concepts such as conditionals and loops and scientific packages such as numpy and matplotlib
*  Visualize neural data, compute summary statistics, and do basic analyses of neural data
*  Know of resources to keep learning and practicing coding and quantitative skills, and have the confidence to do so

## Prerequisites

This boot camp will assume no prior knowledge of coding or Python! However, if you already have familiarity, there will be advanced exercises to practice your skills and learn more advanced analyses.

## Structure

Students will watch prerecorded videos on their own time (max 30-45 minutes a week). During the boot camp sessions, we will interactively review and practice the coding concepts introduced in the videos. Students will work together in small groups on programming exercises and analysis pipelines, often incorporating neural data or neural applications. There will be short recommended weekly homeworks to practice and consolidate the skills learned. 

## Schedule
*Note this is a preliminary schedule for students to get a sense of the topics that will be covered, the exact topics may change*

*Also note that listed topics highlight Python competencies but computational thinking and neural data analysis will be incorporated throughout*
